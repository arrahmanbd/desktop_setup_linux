Make your computer open nemo whenever nautilus is run, by making a symbolic link named "nautilus" in your ~/bin folder, but have it point to nemo!:

mkdir -p ~/bin  # create ~/bin dir if it doesn't exist
# see where the executable for nautilus is; sample output: `/usr/bin/nautilus`
which nautilus  
# see where the executable for nemo is; sample output: `/usr/bin/nemo`
which nemo
# create symlink to back nautilus path up; this allows running 
# `nautilus_real` to run the real `nautilus`!
ln -s /usr/bin/nautilus ~/bin/nautilus_real
# create a new `nautilus` symlink to point to `nemo`; this means
# that if you run `nautilus` it will actually run `nemo`!
ln -s /usr/bin/nemo ~/bin/nautilus
